Pratical 1 Report
===================
Having completed the Tutorial Part of the first Practical,
I would like to reflect on the tools, which where presented
and used in this project and which I will apply in the future.
----------------
Firstly: an IDE. Previously at school we have used CodeBlocks for C++.
In 3 years I had gotten used to that. However, in my free time, when I decided
to get acquainted with Python, I used PyCharm. So using this IDE on a deeper 
level was exciting.

Secondly, Git/Gitlab/NUcode. I have heard about it and seen 
it used before but never got a chance to try it out myself. 
Now I understand their relevance, usage, "fork/commit/push/pull"
commands. Git will definitely come in handy not only on solo 
projects but teamwork as well. 

This was also the first time I encountered Markdown (or even documenting project
overall). As I can imagine, not having to  switch between IDE and Word when 
documenting a project is a true life safer. Markdown helps to keep everything 
organized and  explained in one place. I believe in our future workplaces, 
it will be really useful, therefore learning to use it now is great.

Regarding Dependency Management and Sandboxing, I got the main idea,
however I think I will need to do some more research to fully understand 
them.

"Read the manual" - that is what what I am going to do before and while
extending this project. I know I will find some essential information
there. 

To sum up, I know that all of these tools are and will be extremely useful in the
future. They help to keep projects organized, clear, understandable not only
personally but also to other programmers which is crucial because 
nowadays programming is definitely a team work.
